addInitialDiagnosis -- There is a foreign key constraint error in the table for visitID that will not allow a new diagnosis to be entered. 

OrderTest -- unable to test this method, as the initial diagnosis is required and is not functioning properly. 

addFinalDiagnosis -- Unable to test this method, as the initial diagnosis and orders are not going through.
